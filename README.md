# TerraFirmaGregSmithingCalc

A simple, overengineered, console tool to calculate which smithing moves you have to do.

Best used with the Texturepack that gives you the ability to read the required pointnumber for your desired end product. (found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/tfc-anvil-helper)
